# 🚦 Traffic Light Controller (Verilog)

This project simulates a **Traffic Light Controller** using Verilog HDL.  
It is implemented as a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** and tested via **testbench** using Xilinx Vivado.

---

## 📌 Description

This module mimics the basic functionality of a traffic signal system with three lights:  
- 🔴 **Red**
- 🟢 **Green**
- 🟡 **Yellow**

It follows a simple sequence with timing logic using a counter.

## 🧠 FSM Design

| State      | Output Active | Duration (Clocks) |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| S_Red      | Red            | 5 clocks          |
| S_Green    | Green          | 5 clocks          |
| S_Yellow   | Yellow         | 2 clocks          |

- Transition is controlled via a **4-bit counter**
- FSM transitions only after the counter reaches zero

## 🧪 Simulation

Simulation was performed using **Vivado XSim**.

*(You can replace `waveform.png` with the actual filename of your screenshot)*

The waveform shows correct transitions between `Red → Green → Yellow → Red...` with respective durations.
